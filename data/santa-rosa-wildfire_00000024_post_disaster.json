In the middle-right region (781-905px width, 643-806px height), four clustered destroyed buildings are distributed: the upper middle-right (781-881px width, 643-715px height) features two adjacent ruins with irregular boundaries; the lower middle-right (826-905px width, 731-806px height) contains two more compact destroyed buildings with disjointed contours. The bottom-right corner (993-1023px width, 888-937px height) has a small, elongated destroyed building with fragmented edges. The scene is dominated by messy off-white debris, charred earthy tones, and scattered building remnants, embodying the devastating aftermath of the wildfire."
