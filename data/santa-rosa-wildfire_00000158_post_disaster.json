Multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are scattered across the terrain, visible as messy, off-white and gray patches of rubble. A prominent cluster of ruins is situated in the upper left quadrant (spanning approximately 107-256px width and 0-230px height). In the center of the image, a large devastated complex is clearly visible (roughly 465-561px width and 410-512px height). To the right of the center, two parallel, rectangular debris fields are aligned horizontally (585-637px width, 590-616px height). Other scattered remnants are found in the lower central area (500-603px width, 681-745px height) and along the far bottom left edge (0-25px width, 964-987px height)."
