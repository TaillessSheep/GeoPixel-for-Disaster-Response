Multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are scattered across the landscape, appearing as light-colored, messy patches of ash and rubble. A prominent ruined structure is located in the center (approximately 462-540px width, 562-606px height), with another significant debris field to its right (852-899px width, 489-540px height). In the lower central area, near the road loop, three rectangular foundations are aligned vertically (617-636px width, 785-888px height). Further scattered remnants are visible in the top left corner (0-109px width, 0-40px height) and along the bottom and right edges (roughly 439-1023px width, 696-1023px height)."
