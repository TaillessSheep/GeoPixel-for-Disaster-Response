  "gcg_description": "This aerial image captures a post-wildfire landscape dominated by scorched brown hills and patches of green forest, with a winding road traversing the left side. Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are visible, appearing as messy, light-colored patches of rubble. A prominent ruin is situated inside a road curve in the middle-left (spanning approximately 165-212px width and 531-612px height). Smaller isolated remnants are found nearby (89-99px width, 647-664px height) and along the far left edge (0-11px width, 710-742px height).",
