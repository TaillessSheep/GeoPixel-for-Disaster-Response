A few damaged buildings, characterized by their beige and white tones, are scattered throughout the scene, with notable instances located centrally (334-313px width, 237-225px height) and towards the edges (0-39px width, 23-54px height). The surrounding foliage, now a mix of green and blackened areas, indicates the fire's impact on the local environment. The overall scene is one of devastation, with the sparsely distributed ruins and the fire-ravaged vegetation painting a picture of a landscape in recovery."
