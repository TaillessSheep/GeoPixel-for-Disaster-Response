Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are identifiable as bright, messy patches of white and gray rubble contrasting with the burnt terrain. A significant concentration of these ruins is found in the bottom left quadrant (spanning approximately 233-316px width and 900-995px height), with smaller nearby remnants (60-80px width, 803-817px height). On the right side, distinct pockets of debris are nestled among the trees (roughly 664-730px width, 349-429px height; and 746-823px width, 602-694px height). Additionally, minor fragments are visible along the left edge (0-17px width, 277-305px height) and the top right edge (995-1003px width, 0-4px height)."
