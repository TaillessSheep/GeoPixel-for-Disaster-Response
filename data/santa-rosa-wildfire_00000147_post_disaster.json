Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are visible as messy, off-white and gray patches of rubble. A large, prominent cluster of ruins is located in the upper central region (spanning approximately 471-575px width and 244-390px height). In the bottom right corner, a significant debris field is situated adjacent to a road (roughly 652-755px width and 726-806px height). Scattered remnants are also found in the bottom center (372-449px width, 965-1023px height) and along the upper left edge (58-93px width, 289-350px height). Other smaller damaged structures are dispersed throughout the scene, including near the vineyard areas (633-673px width, 424-463px height)."
