Scattered throughout the scene are multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG], visible as messy, light-colored mounds of rubble. A significant cluster of ruins is located in the bottom right quadrant (spanning approximately 687-758px width and 897-1023px height). Other debris fields are found in the central-left area (29-94px width, 337-407px height; and 112-156px width, 657-719px height). Smaller, isolated remnants are scattered in the upper left (204-263px width, 154-189px height) and along the far right edge (939-1022px width, 124-190px height)."
