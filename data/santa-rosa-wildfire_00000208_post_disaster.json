Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] appear as messy, off-white patches of rubble scattered across the landscape. A notable cluster of debris is located in the center (spanning approximately 312-403px width and 636-703px height). In the lower left quadrant, multiple fragmented structures are visible (roughly 102-188px width and 866-936px height; and 220-250px width, 910-949px height). Isolated remnants can also be seen slightly above the center (315-368px width, 449-504px height) and near the bottom left (89-98px width, 903-910px height)."
