Scattered across the interface of these terrains are multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG], visible as messy, off-white and gray mounds of rubble. A significant, large cluster of devastated structures dominates the upper central area (spanning roughly 428-689px width and 221-416px height). Just below this main complex, a linear group of smaller, rectangular debris fragments is aligned vertically (625-668px width, 459-508px height). Additionally, isolated remnants are found in the upper right quadrant (750-771px width, 171-189px height) and along the extreme top right edge (998-1023px width, 0-36px height)."
