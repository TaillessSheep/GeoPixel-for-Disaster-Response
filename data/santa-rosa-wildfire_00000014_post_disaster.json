In the upper region (663-1009px width, 19-267px height), scattered small destroyed buildings are distributed, including compact structures at (901-935px width, 35-86px height) and (723-755px width, 247-267px height). The middle-left to central area (96-151px width, 734-809px height) features a clustered destroyed building with irregular boundaries spanning multiple coordinates. The central to lower-middle section (405-602px width, 726-917px height) is dominated by a dense cluster of elongated destroyed buildings, aligned vertically and spanning from the middle to the lower part of the image, with key concentrations around (424-602px width, 728-831px height) and (455-553px width, 846-917px height). The lower region (244-787px width, 907-1023px height) contains scattered destroyed buildings: the left (244-409px width, 916-1023px height) has small fragmented structures, the middle (603-702px width, 900-1023px height) features a mix of compact and elongated ruins, and the right (752-784px width, 934-972px height) has a rectangular destroyed building. The scene is characterized by messy off-white debris, charred earthy tones, and disjointed building remnants, reflecting the severe devastation caused by the wildfire."
