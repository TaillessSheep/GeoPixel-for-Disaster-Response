Multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are identified as bright, irregular patches of ash and rubble scattered across the terrain. A prominent cluster of ruins is located in the right-central area (spanning approximately 739-865px width and 361-426px height). Another significant debris field lies along the upper right edge (roughly 960-1023px width and 28-163px height). In the lower central region, damaged structures follow the contour of the land (303-450px width, 747-828px height). Further scattered remnants are visible in the bottom left (144-248px width, 972-1023px height) and along the middle-left side (43-156px width, 95-296px height)."
