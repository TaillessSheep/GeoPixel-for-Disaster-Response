Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are visible as light-colored, irregular patches of ash and rubble. A prominent cluster of ruins lies near a curved driveway in the bottom left (spanning approximately 34-179px width and 750-880px height). In the center of the image, a distinct rectangular debris field is visible (558-602px width, 663-714px height), with another damaged structure located nearby to the left (293-336px width, 578-672px height). Further north, embedded in the trees, are additional destroyed structures (478-534px width, 312-395px height; and 463-522px width, 214-259px height). Finally, scattered fragments are present in the bottom right corner (677-763px width, 927-975px height)."
