In the upper region (0-1023px width, 0-353px height), scattered destroyed buildings are distributed: the left (169-487px width, 0-227px height) has small clustered structures, the middle (500-674px width, 59-274px height) contains irregularly shaped ruins, and the right (752-1023px width, 0-353px height) features compact destroyed buildings with disjointed boundaries. The middle section (486-1023px width, 353-689px height) is densely populated with destroyed buildings, including key clusters around (486-601px width, 405-553px height), (643-870px width, 370-689px height), and (899-967px width, 586-706px height), each characterized by fragmented off-white debris. The lower region (0-1023px width, 689-1023px height) has a mix of scattered and clustered destroyed buildings: the left (0-242px width, 894-1023px height) features elongated and compact ruins, the middle (371-655px width, 888-1023px height) contains clustered structures with irregular contours, and the right (723-1023px width, 689-981px height) has scattered destroyed buildings spanning multiple coordinates. The scene is dominated by messy off-white debris, charred earthy tones, and disjointed building remnants, vividly reflecting the severe devastation caused by the wildfire."
