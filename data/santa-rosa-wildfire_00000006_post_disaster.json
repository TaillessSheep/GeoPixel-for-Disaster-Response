A rectangular destroyed building lies in the upper middle (774-831px width, 30-120px height). The upper right region (860-1023px width, 123-348px height) clusters several small damaged buildings with irregular contours. In the middle left (51-203px width, 421-495px height), three compact destroyed buildings are arranged in a row; the middle area (210-380px width, 579-747px height) features four elongated destroyed buildings aligned horizontally. The lower middle to right (295-649px width, 624-925px height) contains a large clustered area of destroyed buildings with fragmented and overlapping contours. The scene is dominated by messy off-white building ruins, charred vegetation, and muted earthy tones, typical of post-fire devastation."
