Multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are visible as messy, off-white and gray patches of rubble scattered around the facility's perimeter. A significant concentration of ruins is located in the upper left quadrant, west of the running track (spanning approximately 43-265px width and 0-300px height). Another dense cluster of debris is found in the upper right quadrant, north and east of the tennis courts (roughly 702-1023px width and 0-200px height). Scattered damaged structures are also present in the middle-right area near the vineyards (778-970px width, 280-500px height) and along the bottom edge (283-805px width, 969-1023px height). Smaller, isolated remnants can be seen in the central region near the sports fields (299-522px width, 212-482px height)."
