Scattered across the landscape are multiple <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG], appearing as bright, off-white or gray patches of rubble and ash. A distinct group of debris is located in the upper right corner (940-1023px width, 0-160px height). On the left side, near the agricultural fields, two isolated ruins are visible (134-212px width, 308-514px height). The remaining structures are dispersed across the lower middle and right sections (380-944px width, 600-1010px height), all exhibiting the flattened, fragmented look of fire-ravaged structures."
