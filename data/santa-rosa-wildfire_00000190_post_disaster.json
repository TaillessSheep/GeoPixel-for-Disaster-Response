Numerous <p>destroyed buildings</p 、> [SEG] are scattered across the landscape, appearing as messy, off-white and gray patches of rubble. A large concentration of ruins is located in the upper right quadrant (spanning approximately 810-1023px width and 180-270px height). Another significant cluster is found in the middle right area (736-943px width, 530-643px height), with a smaller group further down on the right edge (966-1023px width, 762-810px height). In the lower regions, debris fields are visible in the bottom right (687-758px width, 897-1023px height) and bottom center-left (253-484px width, 841-999px height). Smaller isolated remnants appear on the far left edge (0-59px width, 425-479px height) and in the upper central area (285-357px width, 352-400px height)."
