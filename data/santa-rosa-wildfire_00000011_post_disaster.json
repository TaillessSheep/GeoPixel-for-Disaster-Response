In the upper left (0-234px width, 104-716px height), multiple polygonal structures are scattered, including a clustered area (0-111px width, 682-716px height) and an elongated structure (115-478px width, 683-715px height). The upper middle to right (160-1023px width, 0-302px height) contains dozens of small, irregularly shaped destroyed buildings, such as the compact clusters (748-1023px width, 22-302px height) and scattered structures (676-963px width, 226-382px height). The middle region (0-593px width, 356-573px height) features a mix of small fragmented buildings and larger rectangular ruins, with key clusters around (0-419px width, 542-573px height) and (16-417px width, 400-530px height). The lower half (0-1023px width, 622-1023px height) is densely populated with destroyed buildings: the left (0-280px width, 885-1023px height) has aligned rectangular ruins, the middle (294-515px width, 774-892px height) features clustered structures, and the right (687-1023px width, 724-989px height) has scattered irregularly shaped ruins. The scene is dominated by messy off-white debris, charred earthy tones, and fragmented building contours, embodying the devastating aftermath of a wildfire."
