Numerous <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are scattered across the terrain, appearing as messy gray and off-white footprints of ash and rubble. A dense cluster of these fragmented structures is located in the lower right quadrant (spanning approximately 700-1024px width and 600-1000px height), while others are dispersed through the center (roughly 380-650px width, 470-680px height) and widely scattered along the left and top margins (0-500px width, 50-940px height). The ruins are characterized by their flattened, irregular contours and debris-strewn appearance typical of fire damage."
