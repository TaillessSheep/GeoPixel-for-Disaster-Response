Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are visible as messy, off-white patches of ash and rubble. A distinct group of debris is located in the central area (spanning approximately 578-661px width and 435-614px height). To the right of this central group, another ruined structure is visible (720-762px width, 445-492px height). A cluster of ruins is found in the upper right quadrant (roughly 778-924px width, 100-145px height). An isolated remnant is also visible in the lower central-left region (356-390px width, 602-629px height)."
