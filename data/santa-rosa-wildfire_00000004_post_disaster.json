In the lower right (740-820px width, 860-960px height), several damaged structures with fragmented contours are clustered; a small destroyed building lies in the middle right (817-868px width, 748-799px height); two compact destroyed buildings are located in the upper right (949-987px width, 22-43px height) and upper left (264-300px width, 37-63px height). The scene is dominated by charred vegetation, grayish-black building ruins, and muted earth tones, typical of post-fire devastation."
