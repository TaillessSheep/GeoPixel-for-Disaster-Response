Numerous <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] appear as messy, off-white and gray piles of rubble scattered throughout the landscape. A large, prominent ruin complex is located in the lower central area (spanning approximately 461-585px width and 846-924px height). To the right of the central road, a dense neighborhood of destroyed structures is visible (roughly 744-961px width, 443-593px height). Scattered remains are distributed in the upper right quadrant (861-1021px width, 0-340px height). Isolated debris fields are also present in the top left (22-314px width, 0-375px height) and along the bottom edge (10-281px width, 905-1023px height)."
