Another significant cluster occupies the central and lower-central regions (roughly 368-585px width and 493-924px height). Distinct debris fields are also located along the far left edge (8-130px width, 517-609px height) and on the right side (816-892px width, 588-687px height), with smaller remnants scattered in the top right corner (905-1019px width, 0-84px height)."
