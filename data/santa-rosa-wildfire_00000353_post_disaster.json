Several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG] are identified as messy gray and off-white heaps of rubble contrasting with the natural terrain. A prominent, large complex of debris sits in the center of the scene (spanning approximately 567-671px width and 527-625px height). To the left, a scattered series of smaller ruined structures follows a winding path (roughly 94-341px width and 450-721px height). Additionally, a small isolated fragment of destruction is visible on the far upper right edge (1010-1023px width, 157-180px height)."
