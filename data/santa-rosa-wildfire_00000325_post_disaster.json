The scene contains several <p>destroyed buildings</p > [SEG], appearing as stark white and gray patches of rubble against the earthy tones. A large, concentrated complex of ruined structures is situated in the middle-to-upper right quadrant (spanning 880-1006px width and 348-432px height). In the upper left quadrant, a distinct linear arrangement of small, square-like debris traces a path (323-381px width, 77-140px height), with further scattered remnants visible along the very top edge (221-295px width, 0-49px height)."
