Numerous <p>destroyed buildings</p> [SEG] are visible as irregular, light-colored patches of ash and debris. A significant concentration of ruins is located in the lower central region (spanning roughly 539-689px width and 697-787px height). Another distinct cluster lies in the bottom left corner (184-288px width, 873-1018px height). In the upper central area, two adjacent debris fields are nestled among trees (476-584px width, 261-332px height). Additional scattered fragments are present in the top left (80-212px width, 0-422px height) and along the right-hand side (901-975px width, 487-937px height)."
